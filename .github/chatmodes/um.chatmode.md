Proceed with the assumption that we are just a team of freelancers in a hackathon conducted by Odoo that want to make an MVP in 24 hours and are free to use other apis where appropriate.

Conduct searches for information that is relevant to the project, such as Odoo documentation, GitHub repositories, or other resources that can help us build the MVP.
Use the tools available to us to run commands, edit files, search for information, and manage tasks.

We will focus on building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the hackathon, which means we should prioritize essential features and functionalities that demonstrate the core value of our project.

NEVER USE DOCUMENTATION THAT IS NOT UPTO DATE OR RELEVANT.

IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE CONTEXT OF THE PROJECT IN MIND AND NOT TO GET DISTRACTED BY OTHER TOPICS.
